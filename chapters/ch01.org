** Problem 1
Label the schools "Team 1"\ldots"Team 5." Team 1 has to play Teams 2, 3, 4, and
5 (4 games); Team 2 already played Team 1 but still has to play Teams 3, 4, and
5 (3 games); \ldots; Team 4 already played Teams 1, 2, and 3 but still has to
play Team 5 (1 game); and Team 5 has already played every other team. Thus the
total number of games is for $n=5$ teams is

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^5 (n-i) = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 10.
\end{equation}
